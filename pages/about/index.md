Founded in 2000 by Abe Johnson, Big Johnson Construction began life in the pre-engineered metal building industry primarily as a building erector, servicing a handful of contractors throughout America’s heartland. Having honed his skills working his way up the ranks in the field, Abe saw an opportunity to take what he had learned and combine it with a passion to provide a service unparalleled by any other erection company serving the metal building market at the time. It was a service that would be built on three core values, honesty, integrity and relationships. 

Over the past decade and a half, Big Johnson Construction has earned a remarkable reputation of reliability, professionalism and safety within the pre-engineered industry; often being sought out by leading manufacturers and contractors to get the job done. With up to 15 crews of highly trained and skilled employees, each led by a core of superintendents with decades of experience, Big Johnson Construction is more than equipped to effectively cover the continental United States on projects of all shapes and sizes. 

Through our evolution Big Johnson Construction has grown from being one of America’s elite pre-engineered erection companies to an established specialty subcontractor focused on providing the most comprehensive and competitively priced building packages available, nationwide.
